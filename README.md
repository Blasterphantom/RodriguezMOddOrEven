//Mini Challenge 6 - Odd or Even
//This program will ask the user to input a number, data validate it
//and tell them if it is odd or even
//Peer review - Manuel L., I tested everything out and the code works great, I like how the validation works up to par and doesnt break, yet. But other than that the code look and works great, 10 out of 10.
